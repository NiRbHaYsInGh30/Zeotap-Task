# Zeotap Task

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of two distinct tasks for the Zeotap assignment:

1. **Rule Engine with AST**: A 3-tier rule engine application to determine user eligibility based on various attributes.
2. **Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring**: A real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions using rollups and aggregates.

## Task 1: Rule Engine with AST

### Objective

Develop a simple 3-tier rule engine application (Simple UI, API, and Backend, Data) to determine user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, spend, etc. The system utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and allows for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## Task 2: Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

### Objective

Develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system utilizes data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
